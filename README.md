# Sorting Algorithms in Verilog

This project implements Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort using Verilog for behavioral modeling and analyzes their performance. Gate-level and time delay analyses are conducted for varying input sizes and number ranges. The results are visualized using Python with Matplotlib and NumPy to evaluate the time complexity of the algorithms under different scenarios.

## Features:

### Sorting Algorithms:
- Behavioral models of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort in Verilog.

### Performance Analysis:
- Gate-level and time delay analysis for varying input sizes and number ranges.

### Visualization:
- Time complexity graphs generated using Python (Matplotlib and NumPy).

### Efficiency Evaluation:
- Performance of sorting algorithms evaluated under different input scenarios.

## Technologies Used:
- **Verilog**: For hardware description and implementation of sorting algorithms.
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization (Matplotlib, NumPy).
- **Matplotlib**: For creating graphs and plots of time complexity.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.

## Project Structure:
- **verilog/**: Contains Verilog code for Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort implementations.
- **python/**: Contains Python scripts for performance analysis and time complexity visualization.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions for usage.

## How to Use:

### Verilog Code:
- You can synthesize and simulate the Verilog code using any Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado).

### Python Scripts:
- Run the Python scripts to generate graphs and analyze time complexity.
- Ensure that Matplotlib and NumPy are installed in your Python environment:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib numpy
